# Keybindings

Customize shortcuts in **Settings → Keybindings** on web and desktop. That page
also lists the command IDs and defaults available in your version.

## Edit the configuration file

Keybindings live on the environment's machine, in
`~/.t3/userdata/keybindings.json` by default. You can edit this file directly.
It is a JSON array of rules:

```json
[
  { "key": "mod+g", "command": "terminal.toggle" },
  { "key": "mod+shift+g", "command": "terminal.new", "when": "terminalFocus" }
]
```

T3 Code creates the file with its defaults and adds new defaults on later startups.
New defaults do not replace commands you customized. If a new default overlaps one
of your shortcuts, [rule order](#precedence) decides which runs.
Invalid rules are ignored; if the file cannot be parsed, T3 Code uses defaults.

## Rule shape

Each rule requires a `key` shortcut and a `command` ID. An optional `when`
expression restricts when it runs.

Project scripts use `script.{id}.run`, such as `script.test.run`.

## Key syntax

Join modifiers and a key with `+`, such as `mod+shift+d` or `ctrl+l`.
`mod` means Command on macOS and Control elsewhere. Other modifiers are
`cmd` / `meta`, `ctrl` / `control`, `alt` / `option`, and `shift`.

## When conditions

Available context keys are `terminalFocus`, `terminalOpen`, `previewFocus`,
`previewOpen`, and `modelPickerOpen`. Unknown keys evaluate to `false`.

Combine keys with `!` for not, `&&` for and, `||` for or, and parentheses:

```json
[
  { "key": "mod+j", "command": "terminal.toggle" },
  { "key": "mod+d", "command": "terminal.split", "when": "terminalFocus" },
  { "key": "mod+n", "command": "terminal.new", "when": "terminalFocus" },
  { "key": "mod+w", "command": "terminal.close", "when": "terminalFocus" },
  { "key": "mod+shift+j", "command": "preview.toggle" },
  { "key": "mod+r", "command": "preview.refresh", "when": "previewFocus" },
  { "key": "mod+l", "command": "preview.focusUrl", "when": "previewFocus" },
  { "key": "mod+=", "command": "preview.zoomIn", "when": "previewFocus" },
  { "key": "mod+-", "command": "preview.zoomOut", "when": "previewFocus" },
  { "key": "mod+0", "command": "preview.resetZoom", "when": "previewFocus" },
  { "key": "mod+k", "command": "commandPalette.toggle", "when": "!terminalFocus" },
  { "key": "mod+p", "command": "file.open", "when": "!terminalFocus" },
  { "key": "mod+n", "command": "chat.new", "when": "!terminalFocus" },
  { "key": "mod+shift+o", "command": "chat.new", "when": "!terminalFocus" },
  { "key": "mod+shift+n", "command": "chat.newLocal", "when": "!terminalFocus" },
  { "key": "mod+o", "command": "editor.openFavorite" }
]
```

## Precedence

The last rule whose key and condition both match wins, even if it belongs to a
different command. Put a more specific rule after a general one when they share
a shortcut.

## Commands with special behavior

`chat.new` may ask you to choose a project when there is more than one.
`chat.newLocal` skips that chooser. Both use your
[new-thread defaults](./thread-sidebar.md#start-a-thread).

## Reserved shortcuts

In the desktop app, `mod+w` closes the focused terminal or the active right-panel
tab. When nothing remains to close, it closes the window. In a browser, `mod+w`
closes the browser tab; rebind `rightPanel.close` and `terminal.close` to an available
shortcut such as `alt+w`.

Many defaults include `!terminalFocus` so they do not intercept terminal input.
Keep that condition when remapping them if you want the same behavior.

- `terminal.toggle`: open/close terminal drawer
- `terminal.split`: split terminal (in focused terminal context by default)
- `terminal.new`: create new terminal (in focused terminal context by default)
- `terminal.close`: close/kill the focused terminal (in focused terminal context by default)
- `preview.toggle`: open/close the in-app browser preview panel (desktop app only)
- `preview.refresh`: reload the active preview tab (in focused preview context by default)
- `preview.focusUrl`: focus the URL input of the preview panel (in focused preview context by default)
- `preview.zoomIn`: zoom the preview viewport in one step (in focused preview context by default)
- `preview.zoomOut`: zoom the preview viewport out one step (in focused preview context by default)
- `preview.resetZoom`: reset the preview zoom to 100% (in focused preview context by default)
- `commandPalette.toggle`: open or close the global command palette
- `file.open`: search the active project or worktree and open the selected file
- `chat.new`: create a new chat thread preserving the active thread's branch/worktree state
- `chat.newLocal`: create a new chat thread for the active project in a new environment (local/worktree determined by app settings (default `local`))
- `editor.openFavorite`: open current project/worktree in the last-used editor
- `script.{id}.run`: run a project script by id (for example `script.test.run`)

Use `Cmd+Q` on macOS or `Ctrl+Q` on Windows and Linux. In the default **Hold** mode,
hold for 1.2 seconds or press twice within 500 milliseconds. Holding requires
keyboard repeat; if repeat is disabled, use two presses or the application menu.

Change **Settings → General → Confirmations → Quit shortcut** to **Direct** for a
single press or **Double press** for two presses only. Choosing **Quit** from the
application menu always quits immediately.
